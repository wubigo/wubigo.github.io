      <description>LETTUCE VS JEDIS While Jedis is easy to use and supports a vast number of Redis features, it is not thread safe and needs connection pooling to work in a multi-threaded environment. Connection pooling comes at the cost of a physical connection per Jedis instance which increases the number of Redis connections.
Lettuce, on the other hand, is built on netty (https://netty.io/) and connection instances can be shared across multiple threads.</description>

      <description>删除消费组 XGROUP DESTROY STREAM:TEST STRRAM:TEST:GROUP  Redis latency problems troubleshooting  Make sure you are not running slow commands that are blocking the server. Use the Redis Slow Log feature to check this. For EC2 users, make sure you use HVM based modern EC2 instances, like m3.medium. Otherwise fork() is too slow. Transparent huge pages must be disabled from your kernel. Use echo never &amp;gt; /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled to disable them, and restart your Redis process.</description>
