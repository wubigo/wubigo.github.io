      <description>LETTUCE VS JEDIS While Jedis is easy to use and supports a vast number of Redis features, it is not thread safe and needs connection pooling to work in a multi-threaded environment. Connection pooling comes at the cost of a physical connection per Jedis instance which increases the number of Redis connections.
Lettuce, on the other hand, is built on netty (https://netty.io/) and connection instances can be shared across multiple threads.</description>
