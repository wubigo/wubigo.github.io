      <description>RequiresUser annotation  Requires the current Subject to be an application user for the annotated class/instance/method to be accessed or invoked. This is less restrictive than the RequiresAuthentication annotation.
 Shiro defines a &amp;ldquo;user&amp;rdquo; as a Subject that is either &amp;ldquo;remembered&amp;rdquo; or authenticated:
 An authenticated user is a Subject that has successfully logged in (proven their identity) during their current session. A remembered user is any Subject that has proven their identity at least once, although not necessarily during their current session, and asked the system to remember them.</description>
