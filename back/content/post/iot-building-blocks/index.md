## 物联网架构

An IoT Architecture consists of the following:
- Peripherals, which we call “things”.
- Sensors attached to these things to gauge and transmit their data and information.
- Network connection through which data is transmitted (wireless or wired).
- Remote Cloud to which data is transmitted by the system.
