## Client Side Rendering(CSR)


Rendering an app in a browser, generally using the DOM

The initial HTML rendered by the server is a placeholder and 

the entire user interface and data rendered in the browser 

once all your scripts load.


### PROS

- Rich site interactions
- Fast rendering after the initial load
- Partial real-time updates
- Cheaper to host & scale

### CONS

- SEO and index issues
- Mostly initial bundle.js load duration
- Performance issues on old mobile devices/slow networks
- Social Media crawlers and sharing problems (SMO)

## Server Side Rendering(SSR)

Server rendering generates the full HTML for a page 

on the server in response to navigation


### PROS

- Consistent SEO
- Performance, initial page load
- Works well with Social Media crawlers and platforms (SMO)

### CONS

- Frequent requests
- Slow page rendering (TTFB â€” Time to first byte)
- Complex architecture (For universal approach)
