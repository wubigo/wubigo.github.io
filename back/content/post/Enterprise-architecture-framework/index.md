## Architecture domain

Since Stephen Spewak's Enterprise Architecture Planning (EAP) in 1993, and perhaps before then, it has been normal to divide enterprises architecture into four architecture domains.

- Business architecture,
- Data architecture,
- Applications architecture,
- Technology architecture.
