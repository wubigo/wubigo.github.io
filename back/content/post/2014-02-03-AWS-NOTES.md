```
       The  Cost  Explorer API enables you to programmatically query your cost
       and usage data. You can query for aggregated data such as total monthly
       costs  or total daily usage. You can also query for granular data, such
       as the number of daily write operations for  Amazon  DynamoDB  database
       tables in your production environment
```

- Linux

```
aws ce get-cost-and-usage --time-period Start=$(date -u -d "$TODAY" '+%Y-%m-01'),End=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d" --date="+1 day") --granularity MONTHLY --metrics UnblendedCost --output text
```

***注意：CE服务是按api调用次数收费***

```
