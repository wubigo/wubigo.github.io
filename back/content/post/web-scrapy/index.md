# 用户代理

mobile devices browsing the web often see a pared-down ver‐
sion of sites, lacking banner ads, Flash, and other distractions. If you try changing
your User-Agent to something like the following, you might find that sites get a little
easier to scrape!

```
User-Agent:Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 7_1_2 like Mac OS X) 
AppleWebKit/537.51.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/7.0 Mobile/11D257
