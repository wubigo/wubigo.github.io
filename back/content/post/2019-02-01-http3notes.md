# main goal 

* HTTP/2's multiplexed connections, allowing multiple streams of data to reach all the endpoints independently. In contrast, 
 HTTP hosted on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) can be blocked if any of the multiplexed data streams has an error.
 
 
* reduced connection and transport latency, and bandwidth estimation in each direction to avoid congestion.
 It also moves control of the congestion avoidance algorithms into the application space at both endpoints, 
 rather than the kernel space, which it is claimed will allow these algorithms to improve more rapidly. 
 Additionally, the protocol can be extended with forward error correction (FEC) to further improve performance
 when errors are expected
