# Headless services Without POD selectors

This creates a service, but it doesnâ€™t know where to send the traffic. This allows you to manually create an Endpoints object that will receive traffic from this service.


```
kind: Endpoints
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
 name: mongo
subsets:
 - addresses:
     - ip: 10.240.0.4
   ports:
     - port: 2701
```

# CNAME records for ExternalName

This service does a simple CNAME redirection
at the kernel level, so there is very minimal
impact on performance.

```
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
 name: mongo
spec:
 type: ExternalName
 externalName: ds149763.mlab.com
```
