**NOTICE**

- Don't put ca-key.pem into a Container Linux Config, it is recommended to store it in safe place. This key allows to generate as much certificates as possible.
    
- Keep key files in safe. Don't forget to set proper file permissions, i.e. chmod 0600 server-key.pem.
    
- Certificates in this TLDR example have both server auth and client auth X509 V3 extensions and you can use them with servers and clients' authentication.
    
- generate keys and certificates for wildcard * address as well. They will work on any machine. It will simplify certificates routine but increase security risks.

check  X509v3 Subject Alternative Name(HOST) issued in server.pem
```
openssl x509 -in server.pem -text |grep DNS
```


# Generate self-signed certificates

* Download cfssl
```
mkdir ~/bin
curl -s -L -o ~/bin/cfssl https://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssl_linux-amd64
curl -s -L -o ~/bin/cfssljson https://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssljson_linux-amd64
chmod +x ~/bin/{cfssl,cfssljson}
```

* Initialize a certificate authority
```
mkdir ~/cfssl
cd ~/cfssl
cfssl print-defaults config > ca-config.json
cfssl print-defaults csr > ca-csr.json
```

* Certificate types which are used inside Container Linux

    - client certificate is used to authenticate client by server. .
    - server certificate is used by server and verified by client for server identity.
    - peer certificate is used by cluster as members communicate with each other in both ways.

* Configure CA options
ca-csr.json(Certificate Signing Request (CSR))
```
{
    "CN": "wubigo CA",
    "key": {
        "algo": "ecdsa",
        "size": 256
    },
    "names": [
        {
            "C": "CN",
            "L": "BJ",
            "ST": "Bei Jing"
        }
    ]
}
```

ca-config.json( set expiry to 8760h (1 year))
```
{
    "signing": {
        "default": {
            "expiry": "168h"
        },
        "profiles": {
            "server": {
                "expiry": "8760h",
                "usages": [
                    "signing",
                    "key encipherment",
                    "server auth"
                ]
            },
            "client": {
                "expiry": "8760h",
                "usages": [
                    "signing",
                    "key encipherment",
                    "client auth"
                ]
            },
            "peer": {
                "expiry": "8760h",
                "usages": [
                    "signing",
                    "key encipherment",
                    "server auth",
                    "client auth"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

* generate CA with defined options:
```
cfssl gencert -initca ca-csr.json | cfssljson -bare ca -
ls 
ca-key.pem
ca.csr
ca.pem
```
**Please keep ca-key.pem file in safe. This key allows to create any kind of certificates within the CA**

* Generate server certificate
```
cfssl print-defaults csr > server.json
```
Most important values for server certificate are Common Name (CN) and hosts. substitute them accordingly:

```
...
    "CN": "server",
    "hosts": [
        "192.168.1.6",
        "wubigo.com",
        "localhost",
        "127.0.0.1"
    ],
...
```
 - generate server certificate and private key:
```
cfssl gencert -ca=ca.pem -ca-key=ca-key.pem -config=ca-config.json -profile=server server.json | cfssljson -bare server
```
result following files:
```
server-key.pem
server.csr
server.pem
```

* Generate peer certificate

cfssl print-defaults csr > member1.json

Substitute CN and hosts values, for example:
```
...
    "CN": "member1",
    "hosts": [
        "192.168.1.7",
        "member1.wubigo.com",
        "member1.local",
        "member1"
    ],
...
```

  - generate member1 certificate and private key:
```
cfssl gencert -ca=ca.pem -ca-key=ca-key.pem -config=ca-config.json -profile=peer member1.json | cfssljson -bare member1
```
```
member1-key.pem
member1.csr
member1.pem
```

* Generate client certificate
```
cfssl print-defaults csr > client.json
```
For client certificate ignore hosts values and set only Common Name (CN) to client value:
```
...
    "CN": "client",
    "hosts": [
              ""
    ]",
...
```
- Generate client certificate:
```
cfssl gencert -ca=ca.pem -ca-key=ca-key.pem -config=ca-config.json -profile=client client.json | cfssljson -bare client
```

get following files:
```
client-key.pem
client.csr
client.pem
```
